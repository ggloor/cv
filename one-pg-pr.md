## Expertise.

1) Protein evolution. I use and develop tools to examine how protein structure and function is maintained in response to sequence changes. I have a special interest in identifying the role that variable positions play in protein evolution. I have long taught an undergraduate course protein sequence annotation.

2) Composition and function of the human and other microbiomes. I use and develop tools to examine 16S rRNA gene composition, gene content and expression of mixed population samples (meta-genomes and meta-transcriptomes), and metabolomic analysis of clinical samples. I have experience in metagenomic binning and annotation.

3) Computational biology and the application of techniques for compositional data analysis to the above problems. My primary contribution is ALDEx2 tool in Bioconductor for the analysis of high throughput experiments that generate counts per sequence tag: 16S rRNA gene sequencing, transcriptomics and selex-type experiments. I teach a graduate course, and have delivered many workshops, on the use of compositional data analysis techniques to examine transcriptomes, microbiomes and other types of complex data sets derived from high throughput sequencing.

## Historical and Current Projects

- Bacteriophage Mu molecular biology (PhD)

    - a lot of sequencing and time spent in cold-rooms

- Gene targeting and DNA double-strand break repair (PDF - 2008)

    - first demonstration of gene targeting in a live metazoan (Drosophila)

    - the 'synthesis dependent strand annealing' model of DSB repair

- Protein coevolution (2005 - present)

    - my first foray into computational biology

    - worked out methods to remove the largest source of bias in covariation analysis.

- 16S rRNA gene based microbiome profiling by Illumina sequencing (2010 - present)

    - developed dual-index barcode system for Illumina sequencing  (before Illumina did!)

- Compositional Data Analysis (2013 - present)

    - recognized that high throughput sequencing data are non-linear and compositional and  adapted methods for compositional data analysis to the microbiome and transcriptome fields

    - maintainer of the ALDEx2 R package on Bioconductor (top 15%)

    - developer of and advocate for effect-size plots in place of volcano and MA plots

- Meta-transcriptomics and meta-genomics (2013 - present)

    - current focus is on functionalizing microbiomes using meta-genomic and meta-transcriptomic approaches.

    - working with environmental and human samples

    - identifying non-chromosomal elements

    - hold provisional patent on specific modulation of microbiome composition using conjugative plasmids to deliver site-specific nucleases


## Speaking and Workshops (past 5 years)

   - nine visiting academic lectures
