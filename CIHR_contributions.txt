I have three sets of expertise relevant to this application

 1) Protein evolution. I use and develop tools to examine how protein structure and function is maintained in response to sequence changes. I have a special interest in identifying the role that variable positions play in protein evolution.  I teach an undergraduate course in protein sequence alignment and proteins sequence-structure alignment. With respect to this application this expertise is of critical use when annotating bacterial genomes and metagenomes.
2) Composition and function of the human and other microbiomes. I use and develop tools to examine 16S rRNA gene composition, gene content and expression of mixed population samples (meta-genomes and meta-transcriptomes), and metabolomic analysis of clinical samples. With respect to this application I will supervise the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and the meta-genomic analysis of the samples collected. I have attended workshops in proper metagenomic binning and annotation. I teach a graduate course on the use of compositional data analysis techniques to examine transcriptomes, microbiomes and other types of complex data sets derived from high throughput sequencing.
3) Computational biology and that application of techniques for compositional data analysis to the above problems. My primary contributions so far have been the ALDEx2 tool in Bioconductor for the analysis of high throughput experiments that generate counts per sequence tag: 16S rRNA gene sequencing, transcriptomics and selex-type experiments. Dan Giguere, one of the students on the application has developed a Shiny app for the analysis of such datasets in Biocondcutor. I have contributed new visualization methods (effect-size plots) to the field. I have conducted invited workshops, and have made many invited international talks on these methods:
